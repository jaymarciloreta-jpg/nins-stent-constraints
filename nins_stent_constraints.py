"""NINS stent design constraints from a minimal seed set.

Run inside 3D Slicer (Python Interactor or the slicer MCP).

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A focused tool for one question: does a transnasal stent surface get within
5 mm of the sphenopalatine foramen, and what are the stent's dimensions?

It is NOT the repeatability study. It shares no data with the manual arm and
writes nothing into it. It exists to turn a handful of seed clicks into the
device design constraint table.

WHAT THE OPERATOR PLACES
------------------------
Point fiducials, named exactly. Anywhere INSIDE the named structure: these are
seeds, not landmarks, and none of them has to sit on an edge.

  REQUIRED for the headline number
    SPF_R, SPF_L          one point inside the sphenopalatine foramen

  REQUIRED for length and the lumen profile
    piriform_R, piriform_L    inside the nasal airway at the piriform aperture
    choana_R,   choana_L      inside the airway at the posterior choana

  OPTIONAL, safety clearances
    vidian_R, vidian_L        inside the vidian canal
    FR_R,     FR_L            inside foramen rotundum

Only one side need be present. Missing optional seeds are reported as absent,
never guessed.

WHAT IS DERIVED, AND WHAT IS NOT
--------------------------------
Derived with no operator input, and verified on a real scan:
  - the midsagittal plane, by reflective symmetry of the bone mask.
    Reproducible to SD 0.13 mm across 4 bone thresholds and 2 downsample
    factors, with a sharp optimum (Dice falls 0.037 at 1 mm off-plane).
  - the SPF centre and both apertures, by direction-free minimum feret.
  - the lumen cross section at any plane.

NOT derived, established by testing rather than argument:
  - anatomical identification. Seven approaches have now failed, most recently
    deriving midline bony landmarks by argmax on the symmetry plane: it put ANS
    at the chin and PNS on the sphenoid floor, and read the hard palate at
    66.5 mm against a published 45 to 55 mm. "Most anterior midline bony point
    OF THE MAXILLA" needs to know what the maxilla is. That is recognition.
    Geometry automates. Recognition does not. Hence the seeds above.

HOW TO RUN

    Searching all midline bone does NOT work: an unbounded argmax put the

    also midline bone. Bounding the search to a height band around the SPF and
